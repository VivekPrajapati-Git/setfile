The Folder structure is as follows: 
core folder - contains pure logic i.e no reading but various parts of system
io folder - interacts with the outside system i.e reads file
utils folder - contains small reusable code

cli.py - 


The structure of my project goes like this:
a. cli.py get my parameter
b. file is read using utils folder
c. then the content is passed to core folder
d. then the whole system is information is stored in log file
